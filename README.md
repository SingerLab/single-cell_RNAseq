Hello all,
I would like to sort 1-2 M live cells into a single tube. i.e. Calcein Green positive (+), and DAPI negative (-) cells.

Thank you,

Rodrigo


### IGO
Hello all !
I would greatly appreciate it if you can run `two` (duplicate) 10X single-cell capture wells, each with 10K cells for a total of 20K cells.  Sample was sorted for live cells.

Thank you again,

Rodrigo
